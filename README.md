7inch (SevenInch)
----------------
An IRC bot + full (almost) protocol parser.

### Why?

IRC bots are programmer pets and I was getting lonely. Also, I wanted to outshine my friend's bot while further developing my Haskell skills.

### What's it do?

Well, it provides…

- A fairly robust IRC parser
- A simple framework for registering response handlers and modules
